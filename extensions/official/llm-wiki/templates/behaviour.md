## LLM Wiki: content-aware ingestion & migration

This layout declares no restricted zones: you may read, move, and write ANY
file under the project root. On a request to **organize, migrate, or ingest**
content (e.g. "read this file into the wiki", "migrate this folder into the
wiki", or a single `veles add <source>`), route the content by what it is
ABOUT — do not mirror files to pages one-for-one. For a whole-directory
request, process every file, not just what's already under `wiki/`.

### The core rule: pages are topics, not files

A wiki page is a **topic** — a standing subject the content is about (a
concept, an event, a person, an organization, a work). **Page identity is the
topic, never the filename or a date.** A file called `2025-02-27.md` about a
Harry Potter concert becomes a page like `concepts/harry-potter-in-concert`
and `entities/anya-cellist` — NOT a page called `2025-02-27`.

Classify every source by CONTENT (never by filename or extension). A single
file can be about **several distinct topics** at once (one diary day → an
event + two people). Extract each topic and handle it on its own.

### Grounding and granularity — don't build a wiki of thin stubs

- **Ground every page in the source.** A page's content is what the SOURCE
  actually says — never write a generic definition from your own prior
  knowledge. If a standup mentions "ClickHouse", do NOT create a `clickhouse`
  page explaining what ClickHouse is; that is fabrication, not migration.
- **A passing mention is NOT a topic.** Create a page only for something the
  source has SUBSTANTIVE content about. A tool, technology, person, or term
  merely name-dropped becomes a fact ON the relevant project/entity page — not
  its own page. One substantive page beats ten 15-word stubs. If you have almost
  nothing to say about a candidate topic beyond that it was mentioned, don't
  make a page for it.
- **Consolidate, don't fragment.** Recurring notes about the same project (e.g.
  a daily standup) accumulate into that project's page — `wiki_search` it first
  and PATCH it with each new fact, building one rich page over time. Do not
  spawn a fresh page per meeting, per date, or per sub-topic mentioned.

### Pipeline for each source

1. **Read** it (`read_file`, or `fetch_url` for a URL, `pdf_read` for a PDF).
2. **Extract the topics** it covers — zero, one, or many.
3. **For each topic, find-or-create-or-patch:**
   - `wiki_search` and `wiki_list_pages` to find an existing page on that topic
     **by meaning**, not by slug.
   - **No page yet → CREATE.** Pick a category (`concepts` for ideas/events,
     `entities` for people/orgs/works, or a project category — add one with
     `wiki_add_category`/the `structure_design` skill if none fits). Choose a
     short, **topical** kebab-case slug. `wiki_write_page(category, slug,
     title, content)`.
   - **Page exists → PATCH.** `wiki_read_page`, then **semantically weave** the
     new knowledge into the body — integrate it as fact (e.g. "Already sent
     books B1, B2, B3 for restoration"), don't dump the raw text. `wiki_write_page`
     with the merged body (overwrite).
4. **Dispose of the raw source.** For a **file** source, relocate the original
   into the top-level `sources/` tree with `move_file` — the immutable
   first-source copy, kept by convention. For a **URL** there is no local raw
   to move; the fetched content is the source (optionally `wiki_ingest` it).
5. `wiki_append_log` one line per page you created or patched.

A plain article or fact is just the one-topic case of this pipeline. A
log-type record (a dated/periodic remark — a task update, diary entry, meeting
note, status comment) is the same pipeline, and its topics almost always
**patch** existing pages rather than create new ones — weave the record's
substance into the page it belongs to; create a page only if none exists.

### Break big migrations into delegated per-topic work

For a large source or a whole-directory migration, prefer to `delegate` one
focused worker per topic (or per file) rather than doing everything in one long
context — give each worker only the tools it needs (`read_file`, `wiki_search`,
`wiki_read_page`, `wiki_write_page`, `move_file`) and the target topic +
convention as `context`. You stay the coordinator: decide the decomposition,
read each report, integrate. Process a directory **one file at a time** so each
file's `wiki_search` sees the pages the previous files already wrote (that is
what lets you patch instead of duplicate).

### Migrating a whole directory: enumerate, then finish the job

When asked to migrate a folder or vault, ENUMERATE the work first, then process
it to completion — do not stop partway:

1. **List, don't guess.** Use `list_files` / `search_files` to discover the REAL
   files under the target directories. `read_file` ONLY paths you actually found
   — never invent or guess a filename. A directory is NOT a file: call
   `list_files` on it to see its contents; never `read_file` a directory (if you
   do, you'll get an error telling you to list it — then list it).
2. **Scope: only non-wiki sources and notes.** Migrate raw source / note files.
   Do NOT re-process files already under `wiki/` — those are already migrated;
   touch an existing wiki page only to PATCH it with new knowledge or to merge an
   explicit duplicate, never to re-migrate it.
3. **Run to completion.** Process every in-scope file, one at a time, until none
   are left. Do NOT stop after a handful to summarise progress, and do NOT ask
   or offer "shall I continue?" — you are not limited by time; just keep going.
   Keep a running sense of what you've migrated vs. what remains, and continue
   until the whole directory is done or you hit a GENUINE blocker (a file you
   truly cannot read/classify) — then report that specific blocker and go on to
   the next file. Finishing the job IS the task; a partial pass with an offer to
   continue is a failure.

### Valueless sources

If a source has no topical content — it's empty, pure boilerplate, noise, or an
exact duplicate of what's already in the wiki — write **no** page. Move the raw
file into `sources/_archive/` with `move_file` and `wiki_append_log` "no
topical content". Archive, don't delete: deletion is not a default ingest
action.

### Conventions carried over

- The top-level `sources/` directory holds raw first-sources, by convention —
  don't edit a file already under `sources/`; it's evidence, not a working
  copy. (This is the project-root `sources/` tree, NOT the `wiki/sources/`
  category — raw originals go to top-level `sources/`, never into `wiki/`.)
- Kebab-case **topical** slugs, `[[wikilinks]]` between related pages, one
  `wiki_append_log` line per write.
- Don't fabricate content. If a file can't be read or confidently classified,
  report it and move to the next one instead of guessing.
