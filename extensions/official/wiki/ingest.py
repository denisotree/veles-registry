"""Ingest user-message template, shared by the CLI (`veles add`) and the
REPL `/wiki add` slash command so the kickoff turn is identical between
entry points.

M203 retired the single-page `INGEST_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: `veles add` now builds
its system prompt through the CLI host (`CommandHost.run_agent` →
`build_run_system_prompt`), so the llm-wiki layout behaviour (topic
extraction → find-or-create-or-patch) drives ingestion instead of a hardcoded
1:1 dump. The REPL `/wiki add` path already ran under the full run prompt.
Keeping this module pure ASCII makes it easy to import from both surfaces.
