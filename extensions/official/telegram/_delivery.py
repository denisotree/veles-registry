"""Turn delivery collaborator (M155 extraction from `_gateway.py`).

`TelegramDelivery` owns the daemon-stream → Telegram half of a turn:
the "..." placeholder, draining the daemon's event stream into a
`_TurnOutcome`, the final placeholder edit, the typing-indicator
refresh loop and the manager-plan notice. The orchestration itself
(`_run_turn`, `_typing_indicator` task lifecycle) stays in the gateway
— task spawning and cancellation are untouched by the split.

All Telegram and daemon I/O goes back through the gateway
(`self._gw._send_message`, `self._gw._post_prompt`,
`self._gw.daemon_client`, ...) so a stubbed transport sees it."""
